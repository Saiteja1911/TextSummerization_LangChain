Text Summarization Using Langchain
This is a README file for a project that demonstrates text summarization using Langchain, a framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

Functionality:

This script summarizes a given speech using the OpenAI API and Langchain.
It offers various functionalities including basic prompt summarization, translating summaries to other languages, and summarizing large documents using MapReduce techniques.
Content:

The script first imports necessary libraries for Langchain, OpenAI, and text processing.
It defines an API key for OpenAI access (replace 'your_api_key' with your actual key).
Basic Prompt Summarization: This section demonstrates how to summarize a speech using a simple prompt and ChatOpenAI model.
Prompt Templates Text Summarization: This section showcases using Prompt Templates for specifying the input and desired output format for summaries, including language translation.
StuffDocumentChain Text Summarization: This section explains how to summarize text extracted from a PDF document using a pre-built Summarization Chain.
Summarizing Large Documents Using Map Reduce: This section demonstrates summarizing large documents by splitting them into smaller chunks, summarizing each chunk individually, and then combining them using MapReduce techniques.
Map Reduce With Custom Prompts: This section shows how to create custom prompts for both summarizing individual chunks and combining the final summary.
RefineChain For Summarization: This section explores using a RefineChain for potentially improving the quality of the final summary.
Note:

Replace 'apjspeech.pdf' with the actual path to your PDF file if using the PDF summarization example.
You'll need an OpenAI API key to run the script.
Getting Started:

Install Langchain and other required libraries.
Replace 'your_api_key' with your OpenAI API key.
Adjust file paths for PDF summarization (if applicable).
Run the script."# TextSummerization_LangChain"
