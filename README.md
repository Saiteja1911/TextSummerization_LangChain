Text Summarization Using Langchain
This is a README file for a project that demonstrates text summarization using Langchain, a framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

Functionality:

This script summarizes a given speech using the OpenAI API and Langchain.
It offers various functionalities including basic prompt summarization, translating summaries to other languages, and summarizing large documents using MapReduce techniques.
Content:

The script first imports necessary libraries for Langchain, OpenAI, and text processing.
It defines an API key for OpenAI access (replace 'your_api_key' with your actual key).
Basic Prompt Summarization: This section demonstrates how to summarize a speech using a simple prompt and ChatOpenAI model.
Prompt Templates Text Summarization: This section showcases using Prompt Templates for specifying the input and desired output format for summaries, including language translation.
PDF Summarization with Summarization Chains: Leverage pre-built Summarization Chains within Langchain to efficiently summarize text extracted from PDF documents. These chains streamline the process by handling text extraction and summarization in a single step.
MapReduce for Large Documents: For exceptionally large documents, this section demonstrates a MapReduce approach. The text is split into smaller chunks, each summarized individually using Langchain, and then the summaries are combined to create a comprehensive summary of the entire document.
Map Reduce With Custom Prompts: This section shows how to create custom prompts for both summarizing individual chunks and combining the final summary.
RefineChain For Summarization: This section explores using a RefineChain for potentially improving the quality of the final summary.
Note:

Replace 'apjspeech.pdf' with the actual path to your PDF file if using the PDF summarization example.
You'll need an OpenAI API key to run the script.
Getting Started:

Install Langchain and other required libraries.
Replace 'your_api_key' with your OpenAI API key.
Adjust file paths for PDF summarization (if applicable).
Run the script."# TextSummerization_LangChain"
